TYPO3 Frontend User Registration and Management based on
a very flexible configuration and on TYPO3 8.7 LTS with the possibility to extend it.
Extension basicly works like sr_feuser_register or any other frontend user registration.

https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/femanager/

Quick guide:

  or install it with the classic way (Extension Manager)
- Clear caches
- Add a sysfolder for your Frontend-Users and Usergroups (or separate it)
- Add a new page content of type plugin and choose femanager
- Set the storage page to the new sysfolder
